# My Professional Portfolio.

## This is my professional portfolio as a web developer.

I wanted to create a webpage that would display my professional portfolio as a web developer. I wanted the webpage to include links that would take you to previous work I have completed, links to a section with information about me, and and link to contact me. I also wanted the webpage to be presented with a responsive layout that would adapt to any and all viewports. I created this webpage to display all of this in one easy to read place. I learned alot along the way inlcuding HTML structuring and CSS styling, which is what I used to build out this webpage. I plan to make regular changes to this webpage as I learn more throughout my studies. 


## Usage

To use and view this webpage follow the linked URL.

## Credits

I'd like to credit W3 schools for their inspiration and instruction. I viewed alot of tutorials however I wanted to write all the code myself.
